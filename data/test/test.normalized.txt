Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret and manipulate natural language.
It enables machines to interact with human language in its written or spoken form,
allowing computers to process and make use of the vast amount of natural language data available in the world today.
By analysing the syntax, semantics and context of a given sentence,
NLP technology helps machines to accurately interpret and respond to a wide range of user input and requests.
With the continued advances in NLP algorithms, machines are increasingly able to understand and respond to natural language,
making them increasingly useful for a wide variety of everyday tasks.
GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.
It is a deep learning-based language model developed by OpenAI.
It is trained on massive amounts of text data and is capable of generating human-like text in response to prompts.
ChatGPT is a variation of the GPT language model, specifically designed for conversational AI.
It is trained on a dataset of conversational text and is designed to generate contextually relevant and coherent responses in a chat-like setting.
ChatGPT is optimised for conversational AI use cases, whereas the original GPT is designed for a wider range of NLP tasks.
